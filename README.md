## About

Unpackerr runs as a daemon on your download host or seedbox.
It checks for completed downloads and extracts them so
[Lidarr](http://lidarr.audio),
[Radarr](http://radarr.video),
[Readarr](http://readarr.com), and
[Sonarr](http://sonarr.tv) may import them. 
If your problem is rar files getting stuck in your activity queue, then this is your solution.

Not a starr app user, and just need to extract files? We do that too.
This application can run standalone and extract files found in a "watch" folder.
In other words, you can configure this application to watch your download folder, and
it will happily extract everything you download.

## What's it extract?

Pretty much everything. It also extracts recursively, meaning deep within folders, and archives within archives.
**Tars, Rars, Zips, 7-Zips, Gzips, Tarred gzips and bzips; encrypted rars and 7zips. And ISO disc images.**
Need something else? Ask. Does it do too much? Let me know what knobs you need. [Open a request!](https://github.com/Unpackerr/unpackerr/issues/new)
